    <h2 class="mb-4"> Why We Built LibreBooks</h2>
    <p class="fs-5 mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
      We believe that reading should never be a privilege. LibreBooks was created for students who can't afford books, for curious minds in remote places, and for everyone who believes in the power of knowledge. With a minimal design, mobile-friendly interface, and fast downloads — we keep things simple so that the focus stays on reading.
